# Movie Rating Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on various features using machine learning techniques. The model is trained in **Google Colab**, leveraging datasets and saving trained models for future use.

## Repository Structure
```
ðŸ“¦ Movie-Rating-Prediction
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ data            # Contains datasets (CSV files)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ models          # Contains trained models (e.g., .pkl files)
 â”£ ðŸ“œ README.md       # Project documentation
```

## Model Training & Implementation
- The code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation is executed in **Google Colab**.
- Trained models are saved in the `models/` directory for future predictions.
- The dataset files used for training are stored in the `data/` directory.

## Dependencies
- We have **not** pushed a `requirements.txt` file to the repository.
- To run the code, manually install the required libraries in Google Colab using:
  ```python
  !pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost
  ```

## Usage
1. Download the repository contents.
2. Open the **Google Colab** notebook (not included in the repo but used for training).
3. Load the dataset from `data/` and train the model.
4. Save the trained model in `models/`.
5. Use the trained model for movie rating predictions.
